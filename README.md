# Effects-of-Climate-Change-using-a-Predictive-Model-based-on-Remote-Sensing
The main objective of this project is to predict the future values of various climate parameters such as Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide Emissions, and Precipitation. We intend to design a predictive algorithm and Quality Assessment and Analysis of projected results.
