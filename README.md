# Effects-of-Climate-Change-using-a-Predictive-Model-based-on-Remote-Sensing

The main objective of this project is to predict the future values of various climate parameters such as Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide Emissions, and Precipitation. We intend to design a predictive algorithm and Quality Assessment and Analysis of projected results. 

Human-induced climate change is changing global weather patterns, causing glacial retreats, and increasing the surface temperatures on land. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are prolificating.

Rapid environmental change is causing food and water scarcity, while some species are pushed into extinction due to environmental collapse. The effects of a changing climate can be seen in the areas that we value and rely on, such as water, energy, wildlife, and human health.

If climate change is not monitored effectively then it would lead us to a serious situation. This project aims to quantify the effects of human-induced climate change via remote sensing techniques. 

Future scenarios that are affected by climate change are not inevitable. We already know a multitude of issues and solutions, and continuing research on these impacts keeps generating new ideas.

We are using SARIMA model to predict a few climate parameters such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Carbon Monoxide (CO) Concentration and Precipitation.
